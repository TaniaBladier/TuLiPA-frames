Code:
  * support for more constraints in type hierarchies
  * problem with type constraints: sometimes coreferences get overwritten
    example:
    change_of_state -> prestate=preregion
    change_of_state -> prestate.theme=theme
    vs
    change_of_state -> prestate.theme=theme
    change_of_state -> prestate=preregion
    In the second case, we lose the theme coreference
    -> check unification of feature structures with variables (the coref of the prestate and the free variable of the preregion)
