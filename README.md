# TuLiPA-frames

This is an extension for the existing [TuLiPA](https://sourcesup.cru.fr/tulipa/) (Tuebingen Linguistic Parsing Architecture), a parser for Lexicalised Tree Adjoining Grammars. 
It is extended with semantic frames paired with the elementary trees. 

## Download and Execution
When you cloned the repository, you can start the parser with the example grammar by running `run/test.sh`.


To run the parser with your own grammar, download `TuLiPA-frames.jar` and run 
```
java -jar TuLiPA-frames.jar
```

To get more information on the execution modes, download `TuLiPA-frames.jar` and run `java -jar TuLiPA-frames.jar -h`, or see below.

## Test Grammar
The example grammar parses sentences like `John loves Mary` and `John sleeps`. 
The axiom is `s`.
Example Grammars are stored in the folder 'resources/test_grammar'.
The syntactic information and the frames are stored in one file, `verbs_frames.xml`. 
The type hierarchy with respect to which the frames are unified is stored in `more.mac`.
The lexical information processed by TuLiPA is 2-layered. 
The morphological lexicon maps inflected tokens to their lemma, storing morphological information in a feature structure. 
The lemmas are stored among with semantic information and the tree families to which the lemmas can be anchored.

To see an example of adjunction, run `run/test_adj.sh`. 
This grammar parses sentences like `John really loves Mary`.

## Arguments
To parse sentences, TuLiPA needs a set of resources, which should be given as parameters, either using the graphical interface or the command line. All resources can be generated using [XMG-2](https://github.com/spetitjean/XMG-2/) . The list of arguments is the following:

* Grammar (-g): the Tree Adjoining Grammar. Generated by XMG-2 (compiler `synsem`, or `synframe`).
* Frames (-f, optional): the semantic lexicon, only composed of frames, linked to the trees through the lemmas. Generated by XMG-2 (compiler `synframe`).
* Type hierarchy (-th, optional): the type hierarchy used to determine the resulting type when frames are unified. Generated by XMG-2 (compiler `synframe` + option `--more`).
* Lemmas (-l): the lexicon of lemmas. Generated by XMG-2 (compiler `lex`) or LexConverter.
* Morphological entries (-m): the lexicon of inflected forms. Generated by XMG-2 (compiler `mph`) or LexConverter.
* Axiom (-a): the category expected for the root of the derived tree.
* Sentence (-s): the sentence to parse.
